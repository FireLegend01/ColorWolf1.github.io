<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<i>Wolves are amazing creatures, but are endangered in the wild because of habitat loss and hunting from humans. </i> Roughly 386 wolves were killed by the government in 2020<br> <a href="https://nywolf.org/2021/03/usdas-wildlife-services-killed-386-wolves-in-2020-to-benefit-livestock-industry/" target="_blank">("USDA's Wildlife Service killed 386 wolves to benefit livestock - nywolf, Nov 1, 2021")</a>.<br> <i> That is not even including the wolves that die each year to hunts and wolves that die unexplained deaths.</i> That is on top of any natural deaths from disease, hunts gone wrong, or territorial fights. <strong>Wolves could go extinct if the amount of hunting does not decrease, in fact, they are already hunted to extinction in the lower 48 states of the U.S.</strong> <br><a href="https://defenders.org/wildlife/gray-wolf" target="_blank"> ("Gray Wolf - Defenders, Nov 1, 2021")</a><br> In this article, we will be going over cool facts about wolves, and how if they go extinct, <i>the ecosystem could fall apart.</i> Please try your best to support the wolves and prevent them from going extinct. <strong>If you are not convinced wolves are good for the health of the environment, then read on, you might be surprised to learn many of these facts.</strong> We should all try to help wolves, and other animals that are endangered, survive. We can do this with many non-lethal methods, such as <strong>electric fences that shock intruders. Or traps that capture (but not kill!) them. For a list of methods, visit the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/these-non-lethal-methods-encouraged-science-can-keep-wolves-killing-livestock-180976505/" target="_blank">Smithsonian Magazine</a></strong>, a site that encourages non-lethal methods of protection. Remember, if wolves go extinct, the ecosystem will either be forced to adapt to the constant loss of plant life (covered in the diet segment), or fall apart. </p>

        <!-- End of fact list -->
        <p><i>There are many great facts about wolves some people don't even know about!</i> The list above barely scratches the surface on these amazing creatures. For example, <strong>did you know a wolf could win a race against a cheetah?</strong> <i>Not because of their speed</i>, but because of their endurance. <strong>Wolves are able to run for long periods of time. <a href="https://www.answers.com/Q/Who_would_win_in_a_race_between_a_wolf_vs_cheetah" target="_blank">
    <br>("Who would win in a race between a cheetah or wolf - Answers.com, Nov 1, 2021")</a> <br>Wolves are also very important to the ecosystem, as they prevent herbivores from overpopulating.</strong> If wolves were to go extinct, <i>more and more</i> herbivores would eat grass, trees, bushes, and other plants. <strong>Eventually there would not be very many plants left in the environment.</strong> Heres a small example: <i>Wolves get hunted to extinction in a state where wolves are the primary predator. The deer, elk, and moose reproduce without having many predators to slim their numbers, and herbivores take over. Then the herbivores eat <i>most of</i> the grass and trees, and the landscape is <strong>stripped of almost all life</strong> once the herbivores move on. However, if wolves were to not go extinct, the herbivores would have never taken over, and <strong>the plant and herbivore life would be under control and balanced. </strong> That is why wolves are so important to a healthy ecosystem.

            <p style="text-align:center"><strong>Wolves are carnivorous</strong>, which means they only eat meat. They get this meat by hunting in packs <strong>ranging from 2 wolves to 15 wolves </strong> to take down prey like elk, moose, deer, and other herbivores.  <a href="https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Mammals/Gray-Wolf" target="_blank">
    <br>("Gray Wolf | National Wildlife Federation - nwf.org, Nov 1, 2021")</a><br>  <strong>Wolves typically eat in order from rank.</strong> With alphas getting to eat first and get the more tasteful or filling meat, Then the beta(s) and downward. They typically select old, weak, or sick prey, which keeps elk and other herbivore herds strong while also maintaining a balanced population of them. <br> <a href="https://wolfhaven.org/conservation/wolves/predation/" target="_blank"> ("Predation - Wolfhaven, Nov 1, 2021")</a><br> Wolves will take down their prey by biting their shoulders and flanks. Some pack members will approach the prey from the back while others approach from the front or sides. They will then work together to bring the prey down. Where they then eat in order from highest rank to lowest rank. On the topic of diet, many farmers accuse wolves of eating their livestock. However this is probably false. While they are responsible for some livestock deaths, it is a very negligable amount. According to <a href="https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/HSUS-Wolf-Livestock-6.Mar_.19Final.pdf" target="_blank">humanesociety</a> eagles, hawks, domestic dogs, cougars, and other such predators are responsible for the majority of livestock deaths compared to wolves. Another reason wolves are seen as evil predators who are out for blood is all of the folktales and stories that paint wolves in a bad light, like three little pigs, little red riding hood, and several other stories. However this will be covered in another section of this article.

                <p>Wolf packs have ranking systems in them. The highest rank being the <i>alpha</i> which controls the wolf pack, and the lowest being the <i>omega</i> who gets bullied often and instigates play in the pack.
                    <br>
                    <!-- Alphas -->
                    <h3>Alphas</h3>
                    <p>Alphas are the <strong>highest ranking members of a wolf pack.</strong> There is only <i>two</i> alphas, a male and female. <i>They are the only wolves that reproduce inside the wolf pack.</i> They typically get the best meat of the kill during a hunt. They are the leaders of the pack. They are not submissive to any wolf, as they are the leaders or rulers of the pack. They become alphas by either being promoted from beta, or breaking off from their pack and starting a new one. The latter of which is how the majority of alphas become alphas. There is also the very rare occasion where another wolf challenges the alpha for dominance. They will then fight until there is a winner, if the wolf that challenged them wins, they will become the alpha.
                    <br>
                    <!-- Betas -->
                    <h3>Betas</h3>
                    <p><strong>Betas are the second-highest ranking members of a wolf pack.</strong>  <i>They take over if an alpha is injured and unable to lead, or dies.</i> They eat second, after the alphas. They are submissive to the alphas only as they are the second-in-command. Wolves become betas when the alpha promotes them to such. There is no way to become a beta otherwise.
                    <br>
                    <!-- Average members -->
                    <h3>Average Members</h3>
                    <p><strong>Average members are the basic members of a pack.</strong> They aren't high in rank, but they aren't low in rank. They eat after the alphas and the betas, and are submissive to betas and alphas. This is the rank that the majority of wolves are. They become this rank by simply joining or being apart of the pack. </i>They are the ones that mainly bully the omega.</i>
                    <br>
                    <!-- Omegas -->
                    <h3>Omegas</h3>
                    <p><strong>Omegas are the lowest rank in a pack.</strong> They eat last (after everybody else) and are often bullied alot. <i>Their job is mainly to play around and break up fights.</i> Despite being the lowest rank, without them, wolf packs would probably erupt into battle with themselves. <strong>They also have many other jobs, such as taking care of wolf pups, cleaning other wolf's dens, etc.</strong> Wolves that are this rank are usually made this rank by the alpha.

                    <p> Wolves have a very complex biology and anatomy. Heres a list of some facts relating to anatomy or biology: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> They can smell almost 100x better than humans can because  their brains are designed to have larger portions of it dedicated to processing smell. <br><a href="https://sciencing.com/wolfs-sense-smell-4565769.html" target="_blank"> ("About a Wolf's Sense of Smell - Sciencing.com, Nov 1, 2021")<br></a></li>
                            <br>
                            <li>A wolf typically runs/walks at least 30 miles a day (usually 12) this is because their bodies are built to run after prey.<br><a href="https://www.fws.gov/midwest/wolf/biology/wolfbiology.html" target="_blank">("USFWS: Q and A's about Gray Wolves - fws.gov, Nov 1, 2021")</a><br></li>
                                <br>
                                <li> Wolves have even better hearing than dogs, which means they can hear miles (litterally!) away in an open field. <br> <a href="https://wolf.org/original-articles/how-wolves-use-their-sense-of-hearing-to-engage-the-world/" target="_blank">("How wolves use hearing to engage the world" - wolf.org, Nov 1, 2021)</a><br></li>
                                <br>
                                <p style="text-align:center"> Their anatomy is also very interesting. They have two coats of fur to keep them warm and dry, and have 42 teeth, 4 of which are canines. These teeth allow them to rip into the flesh of prey. They also have many other interesting features about them that we can't cover here because it would become too long! If you would like to learn more then there are several different websites that explain the anatomy and biology of wolves in-depth.</p>

                <p><i>Folk tales have had a lot of influence on how people view wolves.</i> But many folk tales and books always depict the wolf as a <strong>malicious, evil animal</strong> that wants to harm the protagonist or main character. <i>Wolves actually tend to prefer to be away from humanity</i> as much as possible, and live their own lives. <strong>They also don't attack humans often</strong>, there are only <i>2</i> confirmed cases of wolves killing humans in that last hundred years or so. There are also a few cases where wolves have attacked humans, <strong>but the majority of them were rabid</strong>, which means that they had rabies, and didn't know what they were doing. <i>Wolves are judged harshly because of all the stories and tales that say they are bad and shouldn't be trusted</i>. The Three Little Pigs and Little Red Riding Hood do teach valuable lessons, like don't trust strangers and such. <i>But at the same time they are putting wolves in a bad light because they use a "Big Bad Wolf" character to depict things that want to hurt the main character.</i>
